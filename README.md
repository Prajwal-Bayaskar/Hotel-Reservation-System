# Hotel-Reservation-System
In this project I have created an Hotel Reservation Application using C#, html, Windows form, Ado dot net and MSSQL through which we can Add ,Update or delete rooms. 
Admin can Book room ,Cancel Bookings, Add Rooms, and can manage customers as Well.
Admin can Add , Delete or update Employees.


To run the application first put all the files in the "HotelReservation" folder and then unzip the zip files and later run the HotelReservation.sln file.
Also Run the SQL Stored Procedure Commands in your MSSQL.
